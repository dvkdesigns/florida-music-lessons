          Guitar lessons aren’t just about learning chords — they’re about
          unlocking a skill that brings joy, confidence, creativity, and
          self-expression. Whether you’re a beginner starting fresh or an
          intermediate player ready to grow, investing in your music education
          is one of the most rewarding choices you can make.

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          When you learn guitar with a dedicated, real-world musician guiding
          you, you develop skills the right way — faster, smarter, and more
          enjoyably. You’ll build muscle memory, understand your favorite songs,
          and play with confidence in any style you love: rock, pop, blues, or
          beyond.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-10">
          The benefits of guitar lessons far outweigh the cost — because what
          you gain lasts forever.
